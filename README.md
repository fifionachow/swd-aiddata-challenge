# StorytelllingWithData March'19 Challenge - AidData

## Goal
To create visualisations that answer the following:

WHO DONATES? How are donations distributed across countries? Who donates to whom? Are there any patterns, for example some group of countries tends to donate only to some specific group of other countries? Or maybe some countries tend to receive only from a specific set of countries?
